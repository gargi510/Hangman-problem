# Hangman Game

## Project Description
This is a Python implementation of the classic **Hangman Game**. The objective is for the player to guess a hidden word one letter at a time, within a limited number of incorrect attempts. The game uses a predefined word list and displays visual stages of a hangman character to represent incorrect guesses. 

The project makes use of two external files:
- **`hangman_words.py`**: Contains a list of words from which a random word is selected.
- **`hangman_art.py`**: Provides ASCII art for the stages of the hangman.

This simple yet engaging game allows players to test their vocabulary and spelling skills while having fun!
